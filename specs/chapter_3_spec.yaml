title: Machine Learning Fundamentals - Supervised Learning
description: Introduce supervised learning, the most common type of machine learning, focusing on classification and regression.
learning_outcomes:
  - Define supervised learning and its primary goals.
  - Differentiate between classification and regression problems.
  - Understand basic supervised learning algorithms like linear regression and decision trees (conceptual).
  - Evaluate model performance using simple metrics (accuracy, error).
main_concepts:
  - Supervised learning definition: labeled data, input-output mapping.
  - Classification: predicting categories (e.g., spam/not spam).
  - Regression: predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices).
  - Training and testing datasets.
  - Model evaluation (accuracy, error rate - conceptually).
examples:
  - Classification: Email spam detection, medical diagnosis (binary/multi-class).
  - Regression: Predicting stock prices, predicting temperatures.
  - Simple decision tree logic flow.
exercises:
  - Given a problem, identify if it's classification or regression.
  - Propose features for a simple prediction task.
summary:
  - Supervised learning, classification, regression, and basic evaluation.

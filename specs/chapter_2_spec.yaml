title: The Building Blocks of AI - Data and Algorithms
description: Explore the crucial role of data in AI, different types of data, and how algorithms learn from it.
learning_outcomes:
  - Explain the importance of data in AI and machine learning.
  - Differentiate between various types of data (structured, unstructured, semi-structured).
  - Understand the basic concept of an algorithm and how it processes data.
  - Identify ethical considerations related to data collection and usage.
main_concepts:
  - Data types: Structured, Unstructured, Semi-structured.
  - Data sources and collection.
  - Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transformation, feature engineering (basic).
  - Introduction to algorithms (as "recipes" for learning).
  - Bias in data and its implications.
examples:
  - Structured data: Spreadsheets.
  - Unstructured data: Images, text, audio.
  - Simple algorithm concept: Sorting numbers, finding patterns.
  - Examples of data bias (e.g., facial recognition datasets).
exercises:
  - Identify data types from everyday scenarios.
  - Brainstorm potential biases in a given dataset.
summary:
  - Data as fuel for AI, types of data, basics of algorithms and data ethics.

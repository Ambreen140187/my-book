title: Neural Networks and Deep Learning - A Glimpse
description: Introduce the concept of neural networks as inspired by the human brain and dive into the basics of deep learning.
learning_outcomes:
  - Understand the inspiration behind neural networks.
  - Explain the basic structure of a simple neural network (neurons, layers, weights).
  - Grasp the concept of deep learning and its advantages.
  - Identify common applications of deep learning.
main_concepts:
  - Biological neuron vs. artificial neuron.
  - Perceptron (basic conceptual model).
  - Layers: Input, Hidden, Output.
  - Weights and biases (conceptual).
  - Deep Learning: multiple hidden layers, automatic feature extraction.
  - Backpropagation (brief mention as a learning mechanism).
examples:
  - Simple neural network for basic pattern recognition.
  - Deep learning applications: Image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition.
exercises:
  - Describe a simple problem that could be solved by a neural network.
  - Research a deep learning application and explain its real-world impact.
summary:
  - Neural networks as brain-inspired models, deep learning power, and applications.

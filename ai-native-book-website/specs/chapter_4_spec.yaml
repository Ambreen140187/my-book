title: Machine Learning Fundamentals - Unsupervised Learning
description: Explore unsupervised learning techniques used for finding hidden patterns and structures in unlabeled data.
learning_outcomes:
  - Define unsupervised learning and its applications.
  - Understand clustering and association rules as key unsupervised techniques.
  - Explain how unsupervised learning can be used for data exploration and pattern discovery.
main_concepts:
  - Unsupervised learning definition: unlabeled data, pattern discovery.
  - Clustering: grouping similar data points (e.g., K-Means conceptually).
  - Association rules: finding relationships between items (e.g., market basket analysis).
  - Dimensionality reduction (brief conceptual overview).
examples:
  - Clustering: Customer segmentation, document categorization.
  - Association rules: "Customers who bought X also bought Y."
  - Image compression (as a form of dimensionality reduction).
exercises:
  - Given a dataset, suggest an unsupervised learning technique to apply.
  - Discuss real-world applications of customer segmentation.
summary:
  - Unsupervised learning for pattern discovery, clustering, and association rules.

## Glossary of AI Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the book. It's organized alphabetically for easy reference.

### A

**Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem or completing a task, especially in computing.

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: Hypothetical AI that matches or exceeds human cognitive abilities across all domains, as opposed to narrow AI that excels in specific tasks.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

**Association Rules**: An unsupervised learning technique used to discover interesting relationships between variables in large datasets, commonly used in market basket analysis.

### B

**Bias**: In AI, systematic errors in a model's predictions that result in unfair or inaccurate outcomes, often due to imbalances or prejudices in the training data.

**Backpropagation**: A method used to train neural networks by calculating the error at the output and then propagating it back into the network to adjust the weights.

### C

**Classification**: A type of supervised learning task where the goal is to categorize data into predefined classes or categories.

**Clustering**: An unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their characteristics.

### D

**Data**: Information that is collected and used to train AI systems, which can come in various forms such as text, images, audio, or numerical values.

**Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers to model complex patterns in data.

**Dimensionality Reduction**: A technique used to reduce the number of features (variables) in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible.

### E

**Ethics**: The moral principles that govern the development and use of AI systems, including considerations of fairness, accountability, transparency, and privacy.

### F

**Fairness**: The principle that AI systems should treat all individuals and groups equitably, without discrimination based on race, gender, age, or other protected characteristics.

### H

**Hidden Layer**: In a neural network, a layer of neurons between the input and output layers that performs computations on the input data.

### I

**Input Layer**: In a neural network, the layer that receives the raw data and passes it to the next layer.

### L

**Learning**: In AI, the process by which systems improve their performance on a task through experience or data.

**Linear Regression**: A supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values by fitting a straight line to the data.

**Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every task.

### N

**Neural Network**: A computing system inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information in layers.

**Narrow AI**: AI systems that are designed and trained to perform specific tasks, as opposed to general AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can.

### O

**Output Layer**: In a neural network, the layer that produces the final result or prediction.

### P

**Perceptron**: The simplest form of an artificial neural network, which takes multiple inputs, applies weights, sums them, and produces a binary output.

**Privacy**: In the context of AI, the protection of personal data used to train and operate AI systems, ensuring individuals' privacy rights are respected.

### R

**Regression**: A type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict continuous numerical values.

**Responsible AI**: The practice of developing and deploying AI systems in a way that is ethical, transparent, and beneficial to society.

### S

**Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data, with the goal of making predictions on new, unseen data.

**Statistics**: A branch of mathematics dealing with data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation, which is fundamental to machine learning.

### T

**Training**: The process by which an AI system learns from data to improve its performance on a specific task.

**Transparency**: The ability to understand and explain how an AI system makes decisions, particularly important in high-stakes applications.

### U

**Unsupervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, focusing on finding hidden patterns or structures.

### W

**Weights**: In neural networks, parameters that determine the strength of connections between neurons, which are adjusted during training.

**Weights and Biases**: The learnable parameters of a neural network that are adjusted during training to minimize prediction errors.
